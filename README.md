# The OpenPrinting Printing Stack Snap

Complete CUPS printing stack in a snap

## Introduction

This is a complete printing stack in a snap. It contains not only CUPS but also cups-filters and Poppler (as the PDF interpreter). This is
everything (except printer-model-specific drivers) which is needed for printing.

This snap is designed for the following three use cases:

1. Providing a printing stack for a purely snap-based operating system, like Ubuntu Core.
2. Providing a printing stack for a classic Linux system, installing the snap instead of the system's usual printing packages.

Note that the snap is still under development and so does not yet fulfill all the design goals.

## Installation and Usage

The printing stack snap works on both classic systems (standard Linux distributions like Ubuntu Desktop) and purely snap-based systems (like Ubuntu Core).

If on your classic system there is already CUPS running, you do not neccessarily need to stop or remove this CUPS for using the snap. The snap's CUPS will run on port 10631 (instead of port 631) then. So you can have two CUPS instances (each with their own cups-browsed) on one system, for example for development.

Note that running two CUPS instances on one system is not recommended on production systems. Disable or remove your system's CUPS if you want to use the snap's CUPS.

The snap is currently in the Edge channel of the snap store and therefore can be installed via

```
snap install --edge printing-stack-snap
```

If you want to install from source, you have to build it via

```
snapcraft cleanbuild
```

and install it with the command

```
sudo snap install --dangerous <file>.snap
```

with `<file>.snap` being the name of the snap file.

You also need to manually connect the snap to the Avahi interface. On classic systems run:
```
sudo snap connect printing-stack-snap:avahi-control
```
On snap-based systems install the Avahi snap at first
```
sudo snap install --edge avahi
```
and connect to the avahi snap:
```
sudo snap connect printing-stack-snap:avahi-control avahi
```
This allows sharing of printers between your system's CUPS and the snap's CUPS. cups-browsed (one instance on the system, one in the snap) automatically creates appropriate queues. Avahi does not yet work completely on snap-based systems as printers on the snap-based system get shared to remote machines but printers on remote machines do not get discovered by the snap-based system.

For USB printer access you need to connect to the raw-usb interface on both classic and snap-based systems:
```
sudo snap connect printing-stack-snap:raw-usb
```

On classic systems the snap has already access to the user's home directory, on a snap-based system you need to run:
```
snap connect printing-stack-snap:home
```

If there is already a CUPS instance running on your system, The snap's CUPS will run on port 10631.

To use use the snap's command line utilities acting on the snap's CUPS, preceed the commands with `printing-stack-snap.`:
```
printing-stack-snap.lpstat -v
printing-stack-snap.cupsctl
printing-stack-snap.lpadmin -p printer -E -v file:/dev/null
```
You can run administrative commands without `sudo` and without getting asked for a password if you are member of the "adm" group (this is the case for the first user created on a classic Ubuntu system). This is a temporary hack until snapd is able to deal with snap-specific users and groups. This works on classic systems (you can also add a user to the "adm" group) but not on snap-based systems (the standard user is not in the "adm" group and you cannot add users to the "adm" group). You can always run administrative programs as root (for example running them with `sudo`).

The snap's command line utilities can only access files in the calling user's home directory if they are not hidden (name begins with a dot '`.`'). So you can ususally print with a command like
```
printing-stack-snap.lp -d <printer> <file>
```
For hidden files you have to pipe the file into the command, like with
```
cat <file> | printing-stack-snap.lp -d <printer>
```
or copy or rename the file into a standard file.

The web interface can be accessed under
```
http://localhost:10631/
```
but to make administrative tasks working, you have to run the following commands after installing the snap:
```
sudo chmod 711 /var/snap/printing-stack-snap/current/var/run/certs/
sudo chown root.root /var/snap/printing-stack-snap/current/var/run/certs/
```

You can also access the snap's CUPS with the system's utilities by specifying the server (example if the snap's CUPS runs in parallel with a system's one, on port 10631):
```
lpstat -h localhost:10631 -v
```
NOTE: You can also build this snap for CUPS' alternative port being any other than 10631, by editing the file `default.yaml` before building the snap.


## What is planned/still missing?

* CUPS having its own group ("lpadmin") for administrative tasks, we use "adm" as a workaround.
* Auto-connect to all interfaces (avahi, raw-usb, home).
* Add ippusbxd (for IPP-over-USB) to the snap (or snap it separately).


## Change on design goals: Printer drivers deprecated -> Printer Applications

Printer drivers (printer-model-specific software and/or data) in the form of filters and PPD files added to CUPS are deprecated. They get replaced by Printer Applications, simple daemons which emulate a driverless IPP printer on localhost and do the filtering of the incoming jobs and connection to the printer.

Therefore we will not add a printer driver interface as it is not needed any more.

See "Printer Applications" below.
